# Time-Stop-Dungeon
Simple project based on off the game Super Hot. First time using unity and also coding in C# so some syntax may not be optimal.
Characters in the game don't move until directed by keyboard. This applies to both the main character and the monsters. Sprites were from a free package in unity. Background, floor design, treasure chest created in photoshop. 

First two levels were made to show off the basics of the game that could be expanded by creating new levels. Third level is just a huge mess, good luck.
